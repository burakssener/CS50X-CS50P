Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With low level of simulation Brazil seems like a highest probability to be champion but as the number increased belgium is accurate answer

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
